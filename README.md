 ## User Story 
 As a boot camp student, I want to build a portfolio that will be updated over time with the projects I have worked in bootcamp so that I can show my work samples to potential employers. 

 ## Features  
 * Features my online name, avatar, link to sections about me, my work and how to contact me. 
 * When clicking in the nav, the UI will scroll to the proper section 
 * When clicking on the first image, the user will be directed towards a deployed page with the first challenge I completed. 
 * CSS has comments facilitating information on what the styling sheet does.
